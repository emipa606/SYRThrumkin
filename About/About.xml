[h3][b]Adds a humanoid thrumbo race.[/b][/h3]

[i]If you are having issues with the food AI of Thrumkin, enable &quot;use standard AI&quot; in the settings[/i]

[b]Requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=839005762]Humanoid Alien Framework[/url] loaded before this[/b]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1461790308]Harvest Yield Patch[/url] is not required, but highly recommended, otherwise some aspects of the race won&apos;t work as I intended them to.

The Thrumkin are a neolithic race that inhabits different planets, having been captured and brought along for the ride due to their rarity and beauty. 

A large, graceful humanoid creature, with long white fur, a large sharp horn and short simple tail. Their striking resemblance to Thrumbos gave them their name and leaves no doubt to where this race might have originated from. 
		
While generally peaceful they make excellent melee fighters, thanks to their resilent hide and razor sharp horn. Thrumkin live in harmony with nature and know more about plants and animals than most advanced cultures, at least on the planet they are living on.

They are not particularly skilled when it comes to building tools and using them, neither are their structures more than simple protection from the elements.

[b]Advantages:[/b][list]
[*]20% less damage from all sources
[*]Powerful melee
[*]Increased melee hit chance
[*]20% faster plant work
[*]10% higher harvest of plants
[*]20% higher animal yield
[*]10% higher animal tame/train chance
[*]0.5 Beauty base (that&apos;s half a &quot;pretty&quot; trait)
[*]20% higher negotiation ability
[*]Can be sheared for some thrumbo fur
[*]Can eat wood and hay in a pinch
[*]Higher carrying capacity
[*]Doubled foraged nutrition in caravans
[*]Worth 6 royal favor
[*]Worth more as slaves (can also be bad when buying)
[*]200 years life expectancy
[*]You can steal their horn or re-install a broken/stolen one - the item is the same as from thrumbos
[*]You can shear prisoner thrumkin
[*]Can share double beds with non-lovers without penalty to either one (even if one is not a thrumkin)
[*]Will do lovin&apos; with non-lovers if in a shared bed
[/list]
[b]Disadvantages:[/b][list]
[*]Small chance to get lower quality when crafting/building/scultping
[*]33% slower aiming
[*]20% slower drug synthesising
[*]20% slower researching
[*]30% less trade price improvement
[*]50% higher hunger rate
[*]Require special diet, normal nutrition from vegetables, more from animal products, less from meat (lavish meals, survival meals and pemmican will always work normally, ignoring ingredients)
[/list]
Additional feature: Menardy
Menardy is a unique female thrumkin that spawns regularly (not always!) as faction leader for the thrumkin tribe. She has a unique visual appearance and extremely desirable traits and stats (still somewhat randomized). She can be captured and recruited.
